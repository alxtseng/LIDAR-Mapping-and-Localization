Steps for creating a map using Lidar Data from the vehicle.

Overview:
Creating a map requires using the slam_gmapping. Gmapping function will be used to create
a map. This requires two-inputs, the lidar data and the odometry data. The map can then be 
printed as an image. 

Step 1:
Installing gmapping and map server

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-slam-gmapping
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-map-server

Step 2:
Run a master

$ roscore

Step 3:
In a different terminal, start the gmapping node with simulation time on


$ rosparam set use_sim_time true
$ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=lidar1/scan _odom_frame:=base_link

Step 4:
Open another terminal at the location where the rosbag is downloaded and run the following
command

$ rosbag play --clock data.bag

Step 5:
After this bag is done running, an image of the map can be printed

$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f trial

An image 'trial.pgm' will be made in the folder where the terminal was running

Second method ot visualize (using rviz)

Do this after the gmapping command. In a different terminal run, 

$ rosrun rviz rviz

In rviz, add a new display called map. Choose the topic /map. Then continue with step 4.
