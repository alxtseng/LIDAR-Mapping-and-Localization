# LIDAR Mapping and Localization
 
This was a project for my graduate level autonomous vehicle course that I worked on with Kartikeya Sharma, Samir Wadhwa, and Adam Stewart.

Our project was to build a map of high bay (autonomous vehicle garage/warehouse) using lidar and ros mapping software, and then using a particle filter to localize in the map. 

See readme.txt for reproduceability/further details.
